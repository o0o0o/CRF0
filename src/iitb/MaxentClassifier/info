// this document illustrates all the related problems regarding the implementation of MaxEntClassifier. 

the problem of maxentClassifier. 
according to main func. String args[] is taken as the parameter of new Options()
the property: trainFile is mandatory. then one can use maxent.train(fileName);

First I need to understand how to use Options Class and the MaxentClassifier.

TODO:: now that my task is to let this program run with proper training file!:

now what is a MaxEntClassifier. I need to know the problem setting. An example is spam filtering.

so basically, I know what the MaxEnt classifier is. the input is some training data with values of both
independent and dependent variables. and the output is the probabilities of different possible categorical values.
or the most likely value for the dependent variable. 

then how to find out the proper training file? use the exising file in the project. I believe it could be done.
the first way is to generate the training file using matlab.
otherwise, use the
